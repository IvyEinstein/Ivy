            You are a hungry lion looking for food. You have three places to go, the river, grass land and the forest. By going to each place you will burn a certain amount of calories, and more to hunt your meal. Each prey (fish, sheep, or rabbit) has different calories. You have a six-pack and enjoy being fit.
            Get the food!
